# Solves the problem as to if it is faster to mix two soups, using only a single spoon, by:
# 1. Alternatively spooning the soups back and forth, or...
# 2. Completely filling one bowl, then the other
# The metric for completion is acheiving a 55:45 ratio, where the originally dominant soup is the 55
# This problem was posed by my friend Ian, who got concerned about a football player who apparently did this on a date
